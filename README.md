# AR Guitar Learning Web Application

## Overview: Revolutionizing Guitar Learning with Augmented Reality

**Imagine learning your favorite songs on guitar in a way that feels intuitive and magical.** This innovative web application harnesses the power of Augmented Reality (AR) to transform the guitar learning experience. By overlaying dynamic, interactive guides directly onto your physical guitar fretboard, we eliminate the guesswork and frustration often associated with traditional learning methods. See exactly where your fingers need to be, in real-time, as you learn chords and melodies. This project makes guitar learning more accessible, engaging, and ultimately, more successful for aspiring musicians of all levels.
